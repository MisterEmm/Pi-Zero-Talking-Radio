# Pi-Zero-Talking-Radio
A simple and inelegant Python script to read out IFTTT notifications on a Raspberry Pi using Pyvona, a python wrapper for the Ivona TTS service.

This script is used in the Pi Zero Talking Radio project, full project details are at XXXXXX, video is at https://youtu.be/a3V24ywGgSc

Before using this on your Pi you'll need to set up an Ivona developer account at http://developer.ivona.com/en/speechcloud/introduction.html - make a note of your access key and secret key as these are used in the script.

You'll also need to install the Pyvona wrapper, which is available with full instructions at http://zacharybears.com/pyvona/
